        <Description>
          Electron IPC is good, but difficult to maintain and scale, either
          because of the numerous channels you have to remember, or because of
          the inconsistent API between processes and the absence of inferred
          types of your channels and handlers. These are some of the things that{' '}
          <strong>interprocess</strong> <strong>comes to solve</strong>!
