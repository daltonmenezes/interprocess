# Overview

> The native way to handle Electron IPC is good, but difficult to maintain, either because of the numerous channels you have to remember, or because of the inconsistent API between processes, such as, for example, **invoke** that only exists in the renderer process and the **handle** that only exists in the main process, these are some of the things that interprocess comes to solve!

<br />

Features:

<br />

- 🚀 Best-in-class DX with a fully-typed API
- 🧠 Enchanced and consistent API
- 🔥 Type-safe and scalable
- 🪄 Code splitting support
- 🕸️ All edges connected (APIs to handle all processes)
- 💖 `invoke` and `handle` methods in both processes with the same expected behavior
