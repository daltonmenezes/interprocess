# ipcMain
An object that carries `handle`, `invoke` and `remove` methods to manage the asynchronous communication from the main process to renderer processes.

<br />


### ipcMain.handle[channel / handler name]

Register the IPC handler for the given channel. The handler will be called whenever the `ipcRenderer.invoke` method is called with the same channel.

<br />

It can be simply used as the following example:

<br />

```ts
ipcMain.handle.getPing()
```

<br />

Where `getPing` is the name of the channel (handler) registered in the `createInterprocess` or `createIpcSlice` function.

<br />

Also, you can pass a callback function to handle the request from the renderer process if you need to do something before sending the response:

<br />
```ts
  ipcMain.handle.getPing(async (_, { getPing, data }) => {
    // call the registered handler if needed
    const response = await getPing(_, data)

    await ipcMain.invoke.getPong(mainWindow, 'pong')

    ipcMain.remove.getPing()

    return 'The getPong ipc was removed'
  })
```

<br />

### ipcMain.invoke[channel / handler name]

Send a message to the renderer process and wait for the response if needed:

<br />

```ts
const response = await ipcMain.invoke.getPong(mainWindow, 'pong')

console.log(response)
```

<br />

### ipcMain.remove[channel / handler name]

Remove the listener from the main process:

<br />

```ts
ipcMain.remove.getPing()
```
